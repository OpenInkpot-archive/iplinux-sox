	    Hmmm, this is tricky.  Lemme think:
		channel orders are [0][0],[0][1], etc.
		i.e., 0->0, 0->1, 0->2, 0->3, 1->0, 1->1, ...
		trailing zeros are omitted
		L/R balance is x= -1 for left only, 1 for right only
	    1->1 channel effects:
		changing volume by x is x,0,0,0
	    1->2 channel effects:
		duplicating everywhere is 1,1,0,0
	    1->4 channel effects:
		duplicating everywhere is 1,1,1,1
	    2->1 channel effects:
		left only is 1,0,0,0 0,0,0,0
		right only is 0,0,0,0 1,0,0,0
		left+right is 0.5,0,0,0 0.5,0,0,0
		left-right is 1,0,0,0 -1,0,0,0
	    2->2 channel effects:
		L/R balance can be done several ways.  The standard stereo
		  way is both the easiest and the most sensible:
		    min(1-x,1),0,0,0 0,min(1+x,1),0,0
		left to both is 1,1,0,0
		right to both is 0,0,0,0 1,1,0,0
		left+right to both is 0.5,0.5,0,0 0.5,0.5,0,0
		left-right to both is 1,1,0,0 -1,-1,0,0
		left-right to left, right-left to right is 1,-1,0,0 -1,1,0,0
	    2->4 channel effects:
		front duplicated into rear is 1,0,1,0 0,1,0,1
		front swapped into rear (why?) is 1,0,0,1 0,1,1,0
		front put into rear as mono (why?) is 1,0,0.5,0.5 0,1,0.5,0.5
	    4->1 channel effects:
		left front only is 1,0,0,0
		left only is 0.5,0,0,0 0,0,0,0 0.5,0,0,0
		etc.
	    4->2 channel effects:
		merge front/back is 0.5,0,0,0 0,0.5,0,0 0.5,0,0,0 0,0.5,0,0
		selections similar to above
	    4->4 channel effects:
		left front to all is 1,1,1,1 0,0,0,0
		right front to all is 0,0,0,0 1,1,1,1
		left f/r to all f/r is 1,1,0,0 0,0,0,0 0,0,1,1 0,0,0,0
		etc.

	    The interesting ones from above (deserving of abbreviations of
	    less than 16 numbers) are:

		n->n volume change (1 number)
		1->n duplication (0 numbers)
		2->1 mixdown (0 or 2 numbers)
		2->2 balance (1 number)
		2->2 fully general mix (4 numbers)
		2->4 duplication (0 numbers)
		4->1 mixdown (0 or 4 numbers)
		4->2 mixdown (0 or 2 numbers)
		4->4 balance (1 or 2 numbers)

	    The above has one ambiguity: n->n volume change conflicts with
	    n->n balance for n != 1.  In such a case, we'll prefer
	    balance, since there is already a volume effect in vol.c.
