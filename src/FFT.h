 * As regards the windowing function, WindowFunc, Dominic granted a
 * license to it too, writing on the same day:
 *
 *  OK, we're good. That's the original version that I wrote, before
 *  others contributed.
 *
 * Some of this code was based on a free implementation of an FFT
 * by Don Cross, available on the web at:

 * http://www.intersrv.com/~dcross/fft.html [no longer, it seems]
 *
 * The basic algorithm for his code was based on Numerical Recipes
