/*
 * earwax - makes listening to headphones easier
 * 
 * This effect takes a stereo sound that is meant to be listened to
 * on headphones, and adds audio cues to move the soundstage from inside
 * your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of the
 * listener (standard for speakers). This makes the sound much easier to
 * listen to on headphones. See www.geocities.com/beinges for a full
 * explanation.
 * 
 * Usage: 
 *   earwax
 *
 * Note:
 *   This filter only works for 44.1 kHz stereo signals (cd format)
