 * Deemphases Filter
 *
 * Fixed deemphasis filter for processing pre-emphasized audio cd samples

 *
 * This implements the inverse filter of the optional pre-emphasis stage as
 * defined by ISO 908 (describing the audio cd format).
 *
 * Background:
 * In the early days of audio cds, there were recording problems
 * with noise (for example in classical recordings). The high dynamics
 * of audio cds exposed these recording errors a lot.
 *
 * The commonly used solution at that time was to 'pre-emphasize' the
 * trebles to have a better signal-noise-ratio. That is trebles were
 * amplified before recording, so that they would give a stronger
 * signal compared to the underlying (tape)noise.
 *
 * For that purpose the audio signal was prefiltered with the following
 * frequency response (simple first order filter):
 *
 * V (in dB)
 * ^

 *                 3.1KHz    ca. 10KHz
 *
 * So the recorded audio signal has amplified trebles compared to the
 * original.
 * HiFi cd players do correct this by applying an inverse filter
 * automatically, the cd-rom drives or cd burners used by digital
 * sampling programs (like cdda2wav) however do not.
 *
 * So, this is what this effect does.
 *
 * Here is the gnuplot file for the frequency response
   of the deemphasis. The error is below +-0.1dB
