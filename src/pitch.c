 *
 * pitch shifting.
 *
 * I found a code on the Computer Music Journal web site
 * <http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-journals/Computer_Music_Journal/>
 * for pitch shifting the AD 1848 PC soundcards, with
 * a lot of (unclear) pointer and integer arithmetics, and 
 * combine effects (feedback, delay, mixing).
 *
 * I tried to understand the code, dropped the other effects,
 * translated the stuff in float so it's easier to understand, 
 * drop one of the lookup tables (I know that sin(pi/2-x) = cos(x)), 
 * and added interpolation and fade options of my own.
 * cross fading is always symetric.
 *
 * Basically, the algorithm performs a resampling at the desire rate
 * to achieve the shift (interpolation function) on small overlapping windows,
 * and successive windows are faded in/out one into the other to
 * rebuild the final signal.
 *
 * I'm quite disappointed. At first thought, I looked for an FT-based
 * algorithm, something like "switch the signal to frequencies, shift
 * frequencies, and come back to time", but it does not seem to work
 * that way... at least not so easily. Or maybe my attempt was buggy.
 *
 * Here is the result. It can certainly be improved. 
 * The result buzzes some time.
 * Lot of options available so than one can adjust the result.
 *
 * so as to lower the pitch, a larger window sounds better (30ms)?
 * so as to upper the pitch, a smaller window... (10ms)?
 *
 * Some speed-optimization could be added at code size expanse/expense?
