Description: Swiss army knife of sound processing
 SoX is a command line utility that can convert various formats of computer 
 audio files in to other formats. It can also apply various effects to these 
 sound files during the conversion. As an added bonus, SoX can play and record 
 audio files on several unix-style platforms.
 .
 SoX is able to handle formats like Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV, AIFF, VOC, SND, AU,
 GSM and several more.
 Any format support requires at least libsox-fmt-base. Some formats have their
 own package e.g. Ogg Vorbis is provided by libsox-fmt-ogg.
 .
 SoX supports most common sound architectures i.e. Alsa, Libao and OSS
 (provided by libsox-fmt-alsa, libsox-fmt-ao and libsox-fmt-oss). It also
 supports LADSPA plugins.
