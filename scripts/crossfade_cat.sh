# crossfade_cat.sh
#
# Original script from Kester Clegg.  Mods by Chris Bagwell to show
# more examples of sox features.
# Concatenates two files together with a crossfade of $1 seconds.
# Filenames are specified as $2 and $3.
#
# By default, script fades out first file and fades in second file.
# This makes sure that we can mix the two files together with
# no clipping of audio.  If that option is overridden then the
# user must make sure no clipping can occur themselves.
#
# $4 is optional and specifies if a fadeout should be performed on
# first file.
# $5 is optional and specifies if a fadein should be performed on
# second file.
#
# Crossfaded file is created as "mix.wav".
