		SoX: Sound eXchange


SoX (also known as Sound eXchange) translates sound samples between different
file formats, and optionally performs various sound effects.

This release understands:

  o Raw files in various binary formats
  o Raw textual data
  o Microsoft .WAV files
    o PCM, u-law, a-law
    o MS ADPCM
    o IMA ADPCM
    o GSM
  o MAUD files
  o Sound Blaster .VOC files
  o IRCAM SoundFile files
  o SUN .au files
    o PCM, u-law, a-law
    o G7xx ADPCM files (read only)
  o mutant DEC .au files
  o Apple/SGI AIFF files
  o CD-R (music CD format)
  o Macintosh HCOM files
  o Sounder files
  o NeXT .snd files
  o Soundtool (DOS) files
  o Psion (palmtop) A-law files
  o AVR files

The sound effects include:

  o Channel Averaging
  o Band-pass filters
  o Band-reject filter
  o Chorus effect
  o Cut out loop samples
  o Add an echo 
  o Add a sequence of echos
  o Apply a flanger effect
  o Apply a high-pass filter
  o Apply a low-pass filter
  o Pan sound between channels
  o Change the pitch of a sound file
  o Display a list of loops in a file
  o Add masking noise to a signal
  o Apply a phaser effect
  o Convert from stereo to mono
  o Change sampling rates using several different algorithms.A
     'resample' and 'poyphase' effect use high-grade signal rate
     changes using real signal theory!
  o Apply a reverb effect
  o Reverse the sound samples (to search for Satanic messages ;-)
  o Change the speed of samples being played (like speeding up the motor
    on a tape recorder)
  o Stretch/shorten the duration of a sound file.
  o Convert from mono to stereo
  o Swap stereo channels
  o Display general stats on a sound sample
  o Add the world-famous Fender Vibro-Champ effect
  o Adjust volume of samples

History:

This is the 12th release, Patchlevel 17 of the Sound Tools.
SoX was originally written and maintained by Lance Norskog but
unfortunetly he has stopped maintaining it since 1995.  I, Chris
Bagwell (cbagwell@sprynet.com), have started maintaining it since
1996 to the present.

Caveats:

Technically, SoX is made up of a sound file processing library called libst
and SoX is a program implemented using this library.

SoX is intended as the Swiss Army knife of sound processing tools.  It 
doesn't do anything very well, but sooner or later it comes in very handy.
SoX is really only usable day-to-day if you hide the wacky options with 
one-line shell scripts.

Installing:

Unless your using a precompiled binary version, you will need to compile
SoX as described in the INSTALL file.  Please read that file for further
instructions.

Now, read sox.txt and soxexam.txt.  This gives a background on how
SoX deals with sound files and how to convert this format
to that format, and apply various effects.

SoX has an auto-detect feature that attempts to figure out
the nature of an unmarked sound sample.  It works very well.
This feature is used if you specify '-t auto' for the file type.

I hope to inspire the creation of a common base of sound processing
tools for computer multimedia work, similar to the PBM toolkit for 
image manipulation.

If you have bug fixes/enhancements, please send it to me as I would like
to coordinate the releases.  Please document your changes.  I don't 
possess every kind of computer currently sold, and SoX is now beyond 
the phase where I can understand and test most of your contributions.

The majority of SoX features and source code are contributed
by you the user.  Thank you very much for making SoX a success!
